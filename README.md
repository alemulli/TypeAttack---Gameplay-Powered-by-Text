# TypeAttack---Gameplay-Powered-by-Text

A typing challenge game where the words are generated by ChatGPTs OpenAI API, they fall down the screen, and you have to type them before they reach the bottom. If they reach the bottom you lose a life, and three lives and you're out! The level of difficulty/speed increases as you progress from level to level.   

##How to integrate OpenAI API by ChatGPT

Integrating an AI like ChatGPT to generate random words for your game involves making API calls to a language model to obtain word suggestions or completions. You can use OpenAI's GPT models for this purpose. Here's a high-level guide on how to integrate AI for generating random words:

1. Set up an OpenAI API account:

- Sign up for an OpenAI API account and obtain your API key.

2. Install the OpenAI API library:

- You can install the library using npm or yarn in your JavaScript project:

```bash
npm install openai
```

3. Make API calls to generate words:

- Create a function that sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate words. You can use the openai.Completion.create method to generate word completions.

```javascript
const { OpenAIApi } = require('openai');

const openai = new OpenAIApi({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

async function generateRandomWord() {
  const prompt = "Generate a random word: ";
  const response = await openai.Completion.create({
    engine: "text-davinci-002", // Choose the appropriate GPT model
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 1, // Set the desired word length
  });

  return response.choices[0].text;
}
```

4. Integrate with your game logic:

- Call the generateRandomWord function whenever you need to generate a random word in your game.

```javascript
// Inside your game logic
const randomWord = await generateRandomWord();
```

5. Customize and handle errors:

- Customize the prompt to instruct the AI on how to generate words that fit your game's context.
- Implement error handling for API requests to gracefully handle any issues with the AI service.

6. Test and optimize:

- Test the integration thoroughly to ensure that the generated words are suitable for your game.
- You may need to adjust the prompt and other parameters to get the desired word output.

Remember to check OpenAI's documentation for the latest information on using their API, including any updates or changes to the available models and endpoints.

Please note that using the OpenAI API may require you to manage API rate limits, handle potential costs, and comply with OpenAI's terms of service and usage policies.
